### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
I am a Web Developer that uses Frontend technologies such as React or Vue to create modern, stable and user-friendly websites. On the Backend, I employ Node, Express, MongoDB or SQL Databases to provide clients with the ability to scale. 
Right now, I am focused on deepening my skills and learning about Web Accessibility, TypeScript, Design Systems(BEM, SMACSS) and diving into Serverless Technologies(AWS, Firebase) by creating and improving applications every day.
